# Shardeum-Dutch-NFTs-marketpalce
Examples to help you understand how to implement a Dutch auction for NFTs on the Shardeum platform. 
Please note that these examples represent a general concept and may require further development and 
additions depending on your specific requirements.

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies such as OpenZeppelin, ethers.js, and Express. 
Also, replace "CONTRACT_ADDRESS" in the frontend with the actual address of your deployed contract.

This is just the basics and you will need to refine and test the code.
